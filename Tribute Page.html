        <h2 id="sub-title">Who was Albert</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879 in the city of Ulm, Germany was a German physicist of Jewish origin, later naturalized Swiss, Austrian and American.
          In 1905, when he was an unknown young physicist, employed at the Bern Patent Office, he published his theory of special relativity. In it he incorporated, in a simple theoretical framework based on simple physical postulates, concepts and phenomena previously studied by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz. 
          As a logical consequence of this theory, he deduced the equation of physics best known at the popular level: the mass-energy equivalence, E = mc². That year he published other works that would lay some of the foundations of statistical physics and quantum mechanics.

      <h3 id="list-title">Some of his greatest discoveries:</h3>
      <ul id="list">
        <li><strong>Brownian motion:</strong>This discovery, carried out in 1905, explains how the thermal motion of individual atoms can form a fluid.</li>
        <li><strong>Mass-energy equivalence:</strong>Arguably 1905 was one of his best years. Yes, the discovery of this equation ('E = m x c2') also occurred in that year. It shows how a mass particle has a resting energy, different from kinetic and potential energy. It is used to explain how nuclear energy is produced.</li>
        <li><strong>General relativity:</strong>Published between 1915 and 1916, it describes acceleration and gravity as distinct aspects of the same reality. This theory, one of the best known and applauded, postulated the basis for the study of cosmology and the understanding of the essential characteristics of the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>The photoelectric effect:</strong> Also discovered in 1905, it explains the appearance of electric currents in certain materials, when they are illuminated by electromagnetic radiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Special relativity:</strong>This is another contribution exhibited in 1905. It shows that the speed of light is constant, while position and time depend on the speed of the body.</li>
